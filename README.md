# FlightLimits

Using Flight APIs, we can place limit orders to buy Flights at a given price.  We can expand this to do different markets and incorporate different types of orders.

## Set up Development Environment

I currently have it using Duffel's APIs: <https://app.duffel.com/>

Please see the install documentation: <https://duffel.com/docs/developer-tools/client-libraries>

Please see the usage documentation: <https://duffel.com/docs/guides/getting-started-with-flights>

## To Do

* Build a Front End Application - React, React Native
* Upload Flight Data to Database
* Host remote server to call API's at specific times
* Exception Handling all around
* Process Payments - Need Front End First
